# SPECIAL---stat-game
//simple fallout based stat code that can be edited by reading below on how to edit its code

//when editing stats (S P E C I A L), make sure to change the number to your liking in the 10 to 14 line code.
//this can be also done for the number points being applied in the console by changing 8 and 15 line of code that says rem_statpoints.
//to make a new stat or rename one make sure to create or/apply;
//make new line after endurance or after intelligence line but remember to remove (from intelligence) and add "\n" after 'endurance' or ur new stat.
cout << "Endurance      " << endurance << endl;

//afterwards create or/apply in lines between 39 to 55 or after the following, ie; intelligence renamed to 'luck', make sure to remove (inc == "name of stat") if this is //the last line while if it is not add the function. ie;
} else { //last
                        intelligence = intelligence + ass_statpoints;
                        rem_statpoints = rem_statpoints - ass_statpoints;
                    }
} else { (inc == "intelligence")    //not last
                        intelligence = intelligence + ass_statpoints;
                        rem_statpoints = rem_statpoints - ass_statpoints;
                    }                  
//this is v1, i will add more features later
